12)Added command that spawns a name tag renamed to "No Changes" as a reminder to me (The personal commands that I get)

-------------------------------------------[v1.6.0b2]-----------------------------------------------

Note: I'm not too happy with the way the new spawn turned out. It's clean and to the point but it's not very aesthetically pleasing.

1)Pimped the Wild Lobby (Now in the sky) (Might make the cmd block do something above the spawn) (Easter Egg?)
2)Fixed grammar at the "Spawn"
3)Added another locked chest in my house for saved signs
4)Added a link to the FS OneDrive folder at the "Spawn"

-------------------------------------------[v1.6.0b3]-----------------------------------------------

Goal: Move major redstone mechanisms to a different area and use "Wireless Redstone". (Ex: Lighting, Parkour, Sign Easter Egg)
Goal: Make the "Spawn" aesthetically pleasing.

Note: Might move Spawn Mech. to "Redstone Box". (Moved in Beta 4)

Idea: Make every area a floating platform. (Ex: Lobby, Community Area, Office are all separated) (Maybe v2.0.0??)

1)Added the "Redstone Box" (Under the old Spawn) (Empty box encased in redstone)
2)Added a teleport to the "Redstone Box" (My command)
3)Added Idea Sign (The one listed here)
4)Moved Parkour cmds to the "Redstone Box" (It's about time) (Placement & Removal glitches, currently)
5)Moved "Spawn Mech." to the "Redstone Box" (Test teleport commands)
6)Removed unneeded chunks to make the file size smaller
7)Renamed Betas to v1.6.0.
8)Removed "Spawn Mech." teleport in my commands
9)Replaced "Spawn Mech." teleport with Redstone Box teleport in the "Office"
10)Moved "The Animated Sign" redstone to the "Redstone Box"

-------------------------------------------[v1.6.0b4]-----------------------------------------------

Goal: Fix Parkour problems. (Achieved)
Goal: Make the "Spawn" aesthetically pleasing. (Still)

Goal: Make a separate Death Area. (Remove hub teleport at Spawn) (Achieved)

Note: Honestly the shop does not look like it's going to happen. Any suggestions?
